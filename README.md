# Raspberry instock check bot

Get an alert on Telegram when there are Raspberry in stock ready to buy. This bot uses [rpilocator](https://rpilocator.com/) to check for stock updates.

Join the public Telegram channel to get notifications! [@raspberry_alert](https://t.me/raspberry_alert/35)

We also mirror the content of the [rpilocator](https://rpilocator.com/) website on this public API endpoint: [raspberry.rigwild.dev](https://raspberry.rigwild.dev)

üåü Star the project if we helped you get a Raspberry! üôè

To get the `TELEGRAM_CURRENTLY_IN_STOCK_MESSAGE_ID`:

- Right click on the message you want to be updated (message must be in the `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` channel)
- Copy message link
- Take the number at the end

To get a Telegram chat id:

- Use [@RawDataBot](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46247058)
- If it's a public channel, use the public @: `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID='@raspberry_alert'`

## Run with auto-restart

Use [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/)

```sh
pnpm build
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=<telegram_bot_token> <other variables> pm2 start dist/index.js
```

See logs

```sh
pm2 logs
```

Kill

```sh
pm2 delete all
```

## Run with Docker

Use [Docker](https://docker.com)

```sh
docker build -t raspberry-instock-check .
docker run -d -e TELEGRAM_TOKEN='...' -e TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID='...' -e TELEGRAM_ADMIN_CHAT_ID='...' raspberry-instock-check
```

## Test

To simulate some alerts to see if it's working, set the environment variable `NODE_ENV=test`.
